        <p>There are two types of motivation: 1) External: Those fancy pictures,
             motivating quotes and all the other bullshit that emotionally uplift
            come under this category. External motivation is like a drug ie., 
            it feels good when you're under it's influence. 
            It doesn't last. It creates more problems than it solves.
