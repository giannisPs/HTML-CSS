    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>I've personally tried to externally motivate myself from the last 8 months. Downloaded a lot of images, quotes and surrounded myself with a lot of pictures of rich houses, cars etc (you get the idea). This made me more focused for a month at most and then suddenly, I just started rolling back into a depression kinda phase.
        No matter how hard I tried to externally motivate myself, I couldn't do 
        it.
